# Calibrate fan group/zone binaries: Which fan zones exist?
#
# Service Launcher only.
#
# Cross-references fan group/zone assignments between fan header metadata and fan zone
# binary trackers.
#
# When fan control is not zoned, this process is less important, however it is stil relevant
# because subsequent processes monitor fan group (zone) amalgamation of fan header IDs in order
# to ascertain when support for a particular type of fan duty cooling has gone off-line.
##

##
# Fan group/zone alignment validation.
#
# Cross-reference the fan group/zone ID and fan duty category metadata at the fan
# header level with the fan zone binary records. They should match.
#
# If they do not match, go with the revised zone configurations that are based on current
# environmental conditions, and alert the user they should re-run Builder program.
#
# The fan header metadata is treated as the source-of-truth, because it was originally
# derived from the fan group schemas by the Builder program. Each non-excluded fan
# header should belong to a fan group/zone.
#
# When its fan group/zone ID is known, this means the current fan header is related to
# that group/zone ID. In conjunction with its fan duty category, it should be possible
# to determine its ordinal position and fan zone category binary the fan header belongs
# to. This information can then be cross-referenced against the category specific fan
# zone binaries imported via the Launcher .init file.
#
# When fans are controlled via zones, it is imperative these values are aligned.
# When a mismatch is detected, the program may continue, but this is a danger sign when
# the fan control method is zoned. When this is true, the user should be strongly cautioned
# to re-run the Builder. When fan control is not based on a zoned model, this issue is less
# dire, but still warrants proper correction, which requires re-running the Builder.
#
# The metadata for each fan header includes a reference to the fan zone ID it belongs to,
# so long as its category is not "exclude" (excluded fan header). Therefore, the fan header
# should be flagged in the master fan zone binary and the fan zone binary corresponding
# to the fan duty category to which the fan belongs.
#
# Therefore, it is possible to calibrate or reset these dependencies by simply reviewing
# related fan header metadata, which is treated as the source-of-truth or primary authority.
