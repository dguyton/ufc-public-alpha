## Fan control support for this manufacturer is experimental

# This motherboard is incompatible with the fan controller.
# Its fans cannot be controlled manually via IPMI. The board has
# proprietary implementation of MegaRAC middleware with an
# Aspeed AST2400 BMC chip, where the fan controls are not available.
