# 15 addressable fan headers
# 5x 4-pin fan headers J2/J8/J36/J37/J38 
# 5x 8-pin fan headers (4056 fan connectors) J41/J42/J43/J44/J45 
# PWM pin format: pin 1 = ground | pin 2 = tach | pin 3 = +12v | pin 4 = PWM control
#
# However, only the 4-pin fan headers appear to be accessible via IPMI in order to
# set fan speeds manually. The other 10 fan slots seem to be read-only from IPMI's
# perspective.
#
# BIOS fan control is in effect on boot. The BIOS allows a choice of either automatic
# fan speed control or minimum fan speed duty cycles ranging from 10-50%.
#
# It is not known if this BIOS setting impacts the allowed range for IPMI to set fan
# speeds or not.
#
# Support for this motherboard series is considered experimental.
